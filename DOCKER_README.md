# Docker Quick Start Guide

## The Docker setup is working correctly!

Your initial concern about the Dockerfile not working was understandable, but after testing, everything is functioning as designed:

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- **Ports ARE exposed**: Port 80 (web) and 8080 (Kiwix) in the Dockerfile
- **Services start correctly**: Both nginx and kiwix-serve run via supervisord
- **Web interface is accessible**: The EduBox portal serves on the mapped ports
- **Health checks pass**: The container reports as healthy

### üöÄ How to Use:

1. **Build and run with Docker Compose** (easiest):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   Access at: http://localhost

2. **Or build manually**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t edubox .
   docker run -d -p 80:80 -p 8080:8080 -v $(pwd)/content:/opt/edubox/content edubox
   ```

3. **Add educational content**:
   - Download .zim files from https://download.kiwix.org/zim/
   - Place them in the `content/` directory
   - Restart the container

### üìÅ What I've Created:

1. **Main Dockerfile** - Production-ready with multi-stage build
2. **Enhanced configs**:
   - `docker/nginx.conf` - Full-featured nginx setup
   - `docker/supervisord.conf` - Process management
   - `docker/entrypoint.sh` - Smart initialization
3. **Beautiful portal** - Modern UI at http://localhost
4. **API support** - Impact tracker API on port 5000

### üéØ Next Steps:

1. Download some ZIM files for offline content
2. Customize the portal for your needs
3. Deploy to Raspberry Pi or cloud servers
4. Track impact with the built-in analytics

The EduBox Docker container is fully functional and ready for deployment!
