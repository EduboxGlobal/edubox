# 🎯 ORGANIZATION REPOSITORY UPDATE COMPLETE!

## ✅ What We Did

1. **Updated Git Remote**
   - Changed origin from: `yinzara/edubox`
   - To organization repo: `EduboxGlobal/edubox`
   - All commits synced successfully

2. **Added Upstream Remote**
   - Personal repo now tracked as "upstream"
   - Can pull updates if needed

3. **Repository Structure**
   ```
   origin    → github.com/EduboxGlobal/edubox (main development)
   upstream  → github.com/yinzara/edubox (original fork source)
   ```

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED

### Enable GitHub Pages on New Repository

1. **Go to Settings**
   - https://github.com/EduboxGlobal/edubox/settings/pages

2. **Configure Pages**
   - Source: Deploy from branch
   - Branch: `main`
   - Folder: `/ (root)`
   - Click Save

3. **Update DNS** (if needed)
   - The CNAME file already has `edubox.global`
   - DNS should still work, but verify:
   - GitHub Pages URL will be: https://eduboxglobal.github.io/edubox/
