## üöÄ Quick Start

### üê≥ Using Docker (Recommended)

#### Docker Compose (Easiest)
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yinzara/edubox.git
cd edubox

# Build and start EduBox
docker-compose up -d

# Access the portal
open http://localhost
```

#### Docker Run
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t edubox:latest .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name edubox \
  -p 80:80 \
  -v $(pwd)/content:/opt/edubox/content \
  -v $(pwd)/logs:/opt/edubox/logs \
  edubox:latest
```

#### Adding Educational Content
1. Download ZIM files from [Kiwix Library](https://download.kiwix.org/zim/)
2. Place files in the `content/` directory
3. Restart the container: `docker restart edubox`
4. Access Wikipedia directly at http://localhost:8080

Recommended starter content:
- [Simple English Wikipedia](https://download.kiwix.org/zim/wikipedia/) (~200MB)
- [Khan Academy](https://download.kiwix.org/zim/khan-academy-videos/)
- [Project Gutenberg Books](https://download.kiwix.org/zim/gutenberg/)

### üîß Manual Installation (Raspberry Pi)
```bash
# Download and run the installer
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yinzara/edubox/main/install.sh | bash
```

### üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

**Port 80 not accessible?**
If you built the container before June 1, 2025, run:
```bash
./fix-nginx.sh
```
Then rebuild for a permanent fix:
```bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose build --no-cache && docker-compose up -d
```

### üåê Access Points

- **Main Portal**: http://localhost/
- **Wikipedia/Kiwix**: http://localhost:8080/
- **Content Browser**: http://localhost/content/

**Note**: For the best Wikipedia experience, always use port 8080 directly.
