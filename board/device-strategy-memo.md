# Board Memo: Device Access Strategy

**TO**: EduBox Global Initiative Board of Directors  
**FROM**: Leadership Team  
**DATE**: June 2, 2025  
**RE**: Strategic Approach to Device Access Barrier

## Executive Summary

We seek board approval for a hybrid device strategy that maintains our $100 server innovation while ensuring universal access through strategic device partnerships.

## Background

During pilot program planning, we identified a critical barrier: 30-40% of students in our target communities lack access to any device capable of connecting to EduBox. This threatens to exclude the poorest children—exactly those we aim to serve.

## Recommended Strategy

### Three-Tier Approach
1. **Basic ($100)**: EduBox server only - for schools with existing devices
2. **Enhanced ($150)**: Server + 5 basic tablets for shared access  
3. **Complete ($500)**: Server + 25 tablets for full classroom coverage

### Implementation Plan
- **Year 1**: Two-track pilot testing both models
- **Year 2**: Scale through device partnerships
- **Year 3+**: Sustainable regional device solutions

## Financial Impact

### Budget Reallocation (Year 1)
- Original: 100 servers × $100 = $10,000
- Proposed: 60 servers ($6,000) + 40 complete packages ($20,000) = $26,000
- Additional fundraising needed: $16,000

### Fundraising Opportunity
- Maintains "$100 changes 500 lives" messaging
- Adds "$500 complete classroom" major donor option
- Creates "Device Fund" for targeted corporate giving

## Risk Analysis

### Risks
1. Mission creep into device distribution
2. Increased operational complexity
3. Higher capital requirements

### Mitigation
1. Devices remain enablers, not core mission
2. Partner with established device organizations
3. Phased rollout with careful evaluation

## Strategic Rationale

This approach:
- Ensures no child is excluded due to poverty
- Tests sustainable device access models
- Maintains focus on our core innovation
- Creates multiple donor engagement levels
- Positions EduBox as complete solution provider

## Requested Action

We request board approval to:
1. Implement two-track pilot program (device/no-device schools)
2. Allocate 40% of pilot sites to device-included model
3. Pursue device partnerships with manufacturers and refurbishers
4. Adjust fundraising materials to include device options

## Success Metrics

- Device access rates in pilot communities
- Learning outcome differences between tracks
- Cost per student served (both models)
- Sustainability of device programs
- Partner organization engagement

## Recommendation

Management strongly recommends approval of this hybrid strategy. It addresses a real barrier while maintaining our core focus and creating new opportunities for impact and funding.

## Next Steps Upon Approval

1. Update all program materials (Week 1)
2. Begin device partner outreach (Week 2)
3. Revise pilot selection criteria (Week 2)
4. Launch enhanced fundraising campaign (Week 3)
