# Board Memo: Technical Specification Revision

**TO**: EduBox Global Initiative Board of Directors  
**FROM**: Technical Team  
**DATE**: June 2, 2025  
**RE**: Critical Updates to Technical Specifications and Pricing

## Executive Summary

Following careful analysis, we recommend significant revisions to our technical specifications and pricing model to ensure EduBox actually works in real-world conditions.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. Capacity Claims Were Unrealistic
- **Previous claim**: "Serves 500+ students simultaneously"
- **Reality**: Raspberry Pi 4 can handle 30-50 concurrent users maximum
- **Revised claim**: "Serves schools of 200-500 students with scheduled access"

### 2. WiFi Infrastructure Gap
- **Critical oversight**: Rural areas without internet also lack WiFi routers
- **Solution required**: EduBox must include WiFi access point
- **Impact**: Adds ~$40-60 to base cost but is absolutely essential

### 3. Price Point Too Restrictive
- **Previous**: Rigid $100 target
- **Problem**: Excludes necessary components, compromises quality
- **Recommendation**: $200-350 for viable solutions

## Revised Product Line

### Basic Education Server ($200)
- Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB) + WiFi router
- Serves 30-50 concurrent users
- Suitable for small schools (<200 students)

### Standard Education Server ($350)
- Mini PC + enterprise WiFi
- Serves 75-100 concurrent users  
- Suitable for medium schools (200-500 students)

### Premium Education Hub ($500-750)
- Server-grade hardware
- Multiple access points
- Serves large schools (500+ students)

## Critical Insight: WiFi Infrastructure

**The Problem**: We assumed students had WiFi-enabled devices AND WiFi networks to connect to. In reality, rural areas have neither.

**The Solution**: Every EduBox must:
1. Create its own WiFi network
2. Broadcast strong signal (100-200m range)
3. Support 50+ simultaneous connections
4. Work without any internet connection

## Financial Impact

### Original Budget (100 units × $100): $10,000

### Revised Budget Options:
- **Option A**: 50 units × $200 = $10,000 (same budget, half units)
- **Option B**: 30 units × $350 = $10,500 (better hardware, fewer units)
- **Option C**: Request increased budget to $20,000 for quality deployment

### Recommendation: Option C
Better to deploy fewer high-quality units that actually work than many units that fail.

## Strategic Implications

### Messaging Changes:
- **From**: "$100 device for 500 students"
- **To**: "Affordable education servers starting at $200, bringing digital learning to entire schools"

### Competitive Position:
- Still 90% cheaper than traditional computer labs ($5,000+)
- More honest claims build trust
- Better success rate ensures positive word-of-mouth

## Risks of Not Updating

1. **Deployment failures** due to inadequate hardware
2. **No connectivity** without included WiFi
3. **Reputation damage** from overpromised capacity
4. **Teacher frustration** with poor performance
5. **Donor disappointment** in impact

## Recommended Actions

1. **Immediately update** all marketing materials with realistic specs
2. **Revise pilot program** to test different hardware tiers
3. **Include WiFi infrastructure** in all deployments
4. **Set clear expectations** about concurrent vs. total users
5. **Increase fundraising target** to support quality hardware

## Conclusion

These changes strengthen EduBox by:
- Ensuring deployments actually work
- Setting realistic expectations
- Including all necessary components
- Maintaining affordability while ensuring quality

The mission remains unchanged. We're simply being honest about what it takes to achieve it.

## Decision Required

We request board approval to:
1. Revise technical specifications as outlined
2. Update pricing to $200-750 range
3. Include WiFi infrastructure in all packages
4. Adjust fundraising targets accordingly
