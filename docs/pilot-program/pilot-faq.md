# EduBox Pilot Program FAQ

## General Questions

### Q: What exactly is EduBox?
**A:** EduBox is a small, low-cost computer server (about the size of a textbook) that creates a local WiFi network containing educational content. Students and teachers connect their devices (phones, tablets, laptops) to access Khan Academy lessons, Wikipedia, educational videos, and more - all without internet!

### Q: How much does it cost?
**A:** For pilot schools, EduBox is **completely free**, including hardware, installation, and training. After the pilot, schools can purchase additional units for $100 each. This one-time cost covers everything - no subscriptions or hidden fees.

### Q: Do we need internet?
**A:** No! That's the beauty of EduBox. All content is pre-loaded and works completely offline. Internet is only needed occasionally (monthly) if you want to update content, but even this is optional.

### Q: What devices do students need?
**A:** Any device with WiFi and a web browser works:
- Smartphones (Android or iPhone)
- Tablets
- Laptops
- Desktop computers
- Even old devices work great!

## Technical Questions

**A:** EduBox can handle 30-50 simultaneous users comfortably. Throughout a day, it can serve 500+ students as they take turns.

- Solar panel kit (included for schools without reliable electricity)
- Existing solar/battery systems
- Can run 8-10 hours on a small battery

### Q: How much space does it need?
**A:** Very little! EduBox is about the size of a sandwich and can be mounted on a wall or placed on a shelf. It just needs to be in a secure, dry location.

### Q: What's the WiFi range?
**A:** The WiFi covers about 30-50 meters (100-150 feet), enough for several classrooms. Range extenders can increase coverage if needed.
