## The Hidden Challenge

When we talk about bringing digital education to rural areas, we often forget a critical fact: **places without internet usually don't have WiFi infrastructure either**.

This guide addresses how EduBox solves this fundamental connectivity challenge.

## Understanding the Problem

### What We Initially Assumed:
- Students have WiFi-capable devices (phones/tablets)
- Schools have existing WiFi routers
- We just need to provide content

### The Reality:
- Rural schools often have no network infrastructure
- Families may have phones but no way to connect them
- "WiFi" is an unknown concept in many communities

## The EduBox Solution

### Every EduBox Includes:

#### 1. Built-in WiFi Access Point
- **Creates its own network** (no internet required)
- **Range**: 100-200 meters (outdoors)
- **Capacity**: 30-50 simultaneous connections
- **Simple name**: "EduBox" (no password or open password)

#### 2. No Internet Required
- Works completely offline
- Students connect directly to EduBox
- All content stored locally
- No monthly fees or data costs

#### 3. Easy Setup
```
1. Plug in EduBox
2. WiFi network "EduBox" appears
3. Students connect with any device
4. Open browser â†’ automatic redirect to content
```

## Deployment Models

### Model A: Central Location
```
         [EduBox with WiFi]
               |
        100-meter radius
       /       |        \
[Classroom] [Library] [Courtyard]
```
- Place EduBox in central location
- Students gather within WiFi range
- Best for small schools

### Model B: Extended Coverage
```
[Main EduBox] ---> [Repeater 1] ---> [Repeater 2]
     |                  |                 |
[Building A]      [Building B]      [Building C]
```
- Use WiFi repeaters for larger areas
- Cover entire school campus
- Each repeater adds 100m range

### Model C: Multiple Units (Mesh)
```
[EduBox 1] <---> [EduBox 2] <---> [EduBox 3]
                      |
               [Central Hub]
```
- Multiple EduBoxes create mesh network
- Load balancing across units
- Best for large schools (500+ students)

## Power Considerations

### WiFi Power Requirements:
- Access point: 5-15W
- Server: 15-25W  
- **Total**: 20-40W continuous

### Power Solutions:
1. **Grid power**: Where available
2. **Solar**: 100W panel + battery
